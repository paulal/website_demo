# Demo website

This is a demo website using Flask. You can see the website live at demo.iteco.fi

More pages will be added as I get new ideas. Currently, the website has the
following pages:

Etusivu:
    Just the front page, no particular content besides a link to the Github repository.

Finna:
    Search the Finna library database using Finna API. You can search by author or
    book title and select a language. Set any keywords you want to use.

Wikipedia:
    Every time you refresh this page, you get the summary and one picture from a random
    Wikipedia article (from among a list of pre-selected pages).

Polynomin kuvaaja:
    Set the coefficients for a function and the value range for the x axis
    to see the curve.

Ravinteiden saanti:
    An excercise in optimisation. Start typing a food in the first text box, then
    select among the existing options. Type an amount in the second box and click 'Laske'.
    You will get a list of suggested other foods to eat on top of the one you
    selected to meet the daily recommended allowance of a number of nutrients.
    (Note: This page is still under construction.)
    
Roopen Bitcoin-keinottelu:
    A pre-assignment for the Vincit Rising Stars programme. Using the coingecko.com API to display some historical Bitcoin data.
